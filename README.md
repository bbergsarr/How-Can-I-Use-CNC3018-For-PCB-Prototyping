# Downland Universal G Code Sender Program
Universal G-code Sender, often abbreviated as UGS, is a cross-platform Java-based program designed to stream G-code to CNC machines, offering an easy interface and real-time control over operations. G-code is the language used to instruct CNC machines how to move, cut, and drill according to a specific design. UGS acts as a bridge between your computer and your CNC machine, ensuring that the machine follows your commands accurately.

->UGS works with a variety of CNC machines and is compatible with several hardware controllers, including GRBL, TinyG, and Smoothieboard.

->UGS's dashboard provides essential information such as job progress, spindle speed, and machine coordinates, making it easy to monitor and control your CNC machine.

->UGS is its ability to control CNC machines in real-time. You can pause, stop, or adjust the machine's actions as needed. This is particularly useful when running long or complex operations where unexpected issues may arise, requiring on-the-fly adjustments.

->UGS is its 3D G-code visualization tool, which provides a graphical representation of the toolpath before it is sent to the CNC machine. This feature is invaluable in catching potential mistakes in the G-code or previewing how the machine will move. You can zoom in, rotate, and analyze the toolpath in detail, ensuring that the operations will go smoothly.

->UGS supports precise machine positioning using its built-in jogging controls. Whether youâ€™re setting the origin point or moving the machine to specific coordinates, UGS offers smooth and precise control. Additionally, for CNC machines with probing capabilities, UGS supports probing commands, enabling automated measurement and alignment also by using UGS AutoLeveler you can create surface map for precise manufacturing.
